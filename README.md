# Virtual_Mouse
This is a Python-based AI Virtual Mouse system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures detected through a webcam. It uses computer vision techniques to replace traditional mouse interactions with gesture-based commands like moving the cursor, clicking â€” all without touching any hardware!
